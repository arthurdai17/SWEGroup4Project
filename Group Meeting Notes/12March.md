**Goals for Next Friday:**

Pick a picture of the map and divide into regions  
  Code: we need to get these images to display on the webApp and we should be able to click them  
  Use flexbox or grid to style the webApp rather than pos, relative etc 

Divide up the regions between us and we should all research questions for the given region 

Research a good JavaScript quiz template that we can use  

Need to find out how to make a host for the webApp - ask about this } GoDaddy? - find out if we can use this  

Justify and do research on the reasoning for our app – choose age range, features etc 
  If it is for young children we need to find out if there are issues collecting feedback from them 

What are we going to use the BackEnd for?:  
  Users scores/ points? 
  Quiz questions  

Try to make it compatible on mobile  - CSS
