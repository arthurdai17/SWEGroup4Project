**Group meeting:** 

Checked in to see where we are with the project 

Not much progress has been made for a variety of reasons – mainly work related 

Decided to downscale the project and take away some of its functionality I.e. leaderboard, no interactive map, no coins system etc 

 

**15th April meeting with Allison:** 

Suggested that we should scale down further and just focus on getting one country done with a few questions – this is our minimum viable product. 

**Goal for next time:**
To get an up and running front end
