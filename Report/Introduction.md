# INTRODUCTION

### Abstract:

This project was designed to help university students better understand different cultures from across the world. Students attending university often find themselves amongst people from different cultures and backgrounds. This can sometimes make it difficult to find common ground, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the cultures in question. While university can sometimes be challenging in this regard, it is also a great opportunity to connect with people and open dialogues which can allow for a better understanding of each other's cultures and beliefs. An effective way to connect with people is through finding common ground. One of the main objectives of this project therefore, was to do just that. By showing students things they have in common, the barriers to starting these all-important conversations can be lowered and dialogues and friendships can begin to flourish.  

The motivation for this project goes beyond the scope of life at university. As we look around the world, we can see numerous conflicts taking place – from civil wars to conflicts on a global scale. The vast majority of these conflicts arise not as a result of clashing civilizations, but rather a clash of ignorance. Stories are often presented out of context and without this context conflict in many cases is an inevitable outcome. This project is the first step towards resolving problems such as these by addressing the problem earlier on. University students are soon to be leaders of tomorrow and their views will likely shape our future. By opening a small window into the lives of others, we open the door to more tolerance and understanding in the world. The International Baccalaureate mission statement captures this most appropriately in its closing remarks - “other people, with their differences, can also be right” (IB Mission Statement, n.d.). 

The project itself is in the form of a web application that revolves around the idea of serious play. This was an important element as we wanted the project to be both interactive and engaging to give it the greatest chance of success. Both of these targets are a natural consequence of following the serious play framework. We decided that the game should be in the form of a multiple-choice quiz. Many learning applications focus solely on content delivery. We wanted to create something moved beyond content delivery to having a stronger focus on the learning and retaining of the content being delivered. By implementing a quiz, we were able to take advantage of the active-recall framework, where students are continuously tested on new content as part of the learning process rather than as an afterthought.

### Project Objectives:

There are a number of high-level objectives that we set out to achieve for this project. These are listed below: 

1. To bring people together by creating an application that helps identify the cultural similarities they have with one-another.

2. To deliver information in a way that is interactive and engaging so that users enjoy using the application (and are likely to continue using it). 

3. To implement a system that will help users remember what they have learnt.
