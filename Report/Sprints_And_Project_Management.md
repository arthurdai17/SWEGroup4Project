# SPRINTS & PROJECT MANAGEMENT 

### AGILE Methodology 

This project was conducted using the AGILE methodology due to both its flexibility and its effectiveness in allowing a product to be delivered as close to specification as possible. There are numerous approaches to AGILE, however the two main approaches are the Scrum and Kanban methodologies. When starting this project, we set out to implement a Scrum framework, primarily because we wanted to create a working version of the application at the soonest possible date, after which amendments could be made. We set out a timeline to map the various sprint intervals and outlined the first batch of tasks that would need to be completed by the end of the first sprint. However, as we progressed through the project, we found it increasingly challenging to stick to the rigid timeline for sprints, most notably due to external pressures.  

It appeared that we were naturally shifting towards more of a Kanban framework. Initially we had clearly defined roles for the different parts of the project. However, these lines began to blur somewhat as the project progressed and the team became more collaborative. While Scrum had rigid sprint intervals, the Kanban approach allowed goals to be set more on a needs-basis. During meetings we discussed what progress had been made and concluded the meetings with a summary of the priorities to be addressed before the next meeting. These would sometimes change from meeting to meeting – something that would not have been possible in the Scrum framework. It also allowed us to add and remove tasks at any point on the project timeline, which allowed for much more flexibility. All meetings were conducted using Microsoft Teams. The benefit of this is that Teams allows you to create separate groups for the various projects you are undertaking. It was therefore easy to create a specific group for this project where the whole team could meet. It was also clear that everyone was familiar with how to use Teams was able to gain access to it. We wanted to reduce the friction to attending meetings as much as possible as regular team discussions are a critical part of the AGILE framework. 

Another way the team was able to communicate progress was through the use of both Git and Microsoft OneDrive, which provided a way for progress to be tracked outside of the team meetings. OneDrive seemed the most logical choice since it was a service that everyone had access to through their university account. It also allowed us to create a shared folder where all documents could be collected and distributed to the entire team quickly and effectively. One of the key benefits of OneDrive is that multiple people can open a file at the same time and edit it in real-time. This proved to be very useful, particularly in the initial brainstorming stages of the project where it was beneficial to get as many ideas down on paper as possible from all team members. 

### Team Roles 

Given that the Scrum framework requires the use of clearly defined roles for team members, our initial meetings were mainly used to determine how the project should be split and which roles should be allocated to each team member. To begin with, the project was split into 3 main sections, and the roles were allocated as follows: 

1. Front-End (Jehan, Richard & Alfred) 

2. Back-End (Imran & Arthur) 

3. Report Writing (All Team) 

The front-end team were in charge of putting together a user interface. This involved learning and implementing React, HTML & CSS to produce the graphical interface that users would interact with.  

The back-end team were in charge of creating and implementing the database, which would be used to store questions and answers for the quiz as well as the points allocated for each question. This could later be linked to the front-end to create a dynamic web-application.  

Since team members were specialising in different aspect of the project, it was decided that the report should be written collaboratively, with each member of the team outlining their contribution to the project (as they would be the most knowledgeable in their given area). 

The roles were allocated based on what we believed to be the strengths/areas of expertise of each individual, based on the discussions that took place during the team meetings.  

However, as the project progressed, it became clear that the team was finding it increasingly challenging to keep up with their allocated tasks. It was at this point that we decided to make the switch from a Scrum approach to a Kanban approach. This allowed us to abolish the well-defined team roles and work more collaboratively in all areas of the project, with team members offering assistance in any area they felt they could be of help. This reduced pressure had the effect of both boosting morale and increasing the teams creativity. Individual members were much more liberal with their ideas in meetings as they felt more could be accomplished together rather than by depending on just one or two people.  

This lower sense of pressure however, seemed to work against the team in the latter part of the project. Team members were keen to share ideas, but less implementation was taking place. This is likely a result of a shift in mentality, where each member felt that someone else was more ‘qualified’ to take the lead on a given task and was therefore less likely to take action themselves. A new framework was necessary, one that had the flexibility of the Kanban framework but also the formal role structure to ensure there was individual responsibility for work. It was decided that a hybrid framework that drew ideas from both methodologies was necessary. Below are the designated roles that followed: 

1. Technical Lead (Jehan) 

2. Documentation Lead (Imran) 

3. Front/Back End Management & Integration (Arthur) 

4. Server-Side Technical Lead (Richard) 

5. Content & Feedback (Alfred) 

The above roles were assigned based on a re-evaluation of the team’s individual strengths.
